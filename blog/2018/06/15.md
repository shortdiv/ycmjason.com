# Let me explain to you what is `this`. (Javascript)

`this` in Javascript is the probably most magical keyword in the programming world. It's unpredictable nature has reached to an unprecedented level.

![it's over 9000!!!](https://media0.giphy.com/media/MvedbKot538WY/giphy.gif)

However, it is essential to understand it fully if you wish to become a master of Javascript. So let me try to explain you **what is `this`**. (if it doesn't work, well, at least I tried.)

## Functions

Starting with functions. In this article, I would like to put functions into 3 difference categories.

1. Normal functions
2. Arrow functions
3. Bound functions

### Normal functions

I define normal functions as any function created with...
```js
// function declaration
function magic() {
	...
}

// function expression
const magic = function() {
	...
};

// (or if you hate your life)
// function constructor
const magic = new Function('...');
```

### Arrow functions

Arrow functions are basically the ES6 arrow functions:

```js
const magic = () => {
	...
};
```

### Bound functions
Bound functions can be created by calling `Function.prototype.bind` on a normal functions. 

```js
// magic is created with function declaration/expression/constructor
const bound = magic.bind(...);
```

## Ways to call a function

Now let's say we have a function `f` (any category). There are 2 ways to call it.

1. Implicit (direct) calls
2. Explicit calls

### Implicit (direct) calls

Implicit (direct) calls are boring:

```js
/* f is defined */

// direct call
f();

// or attach it to an object and call it
const obj = {};
obj.fn = f;
obj.fn();
```

### Explicit call

Explicit calls are more interesting. You can call your function with `Function.prototype.call` or `Function.prototype.apply`.

```js
/* f is defined */

// Function.prototype.call
f.call(...);

// Function.prototype.apply
f.apply(...);
```

## Quick recap
Let's do a quick recap, we have 3 categories of functions:

1. Normal functions - created with function declaration/expression/constructor
3. Arrow functions - `() => {...}`
4. Bound functions - created with `f.bind(...)`

And 2 ways to call a function:

1. Implicit (direct) calls - `f()` or `obj.f()`
2. Explicit calls - `f.call(...)` or `f.apply(...)`

This means we have 6 difference scenarios. 

1. Normal functions + Implicit (direct) calls
2. Normal functions + Explicit calls
3. Arrow functions + Implicit (direct) calls
4. Arrow functions + Explicit calls
5. Bound functions + Implicit (direct) calls
6. Bound functions + Explicit calls

Don't panic, it is not that scary.

In fact, arrow functions and bound functions do not care about implicit/explicit calls. So this reduces down to only 4 scenarios:

1. Normal functions + Implicit (direct) calls
2. Normal functions + Explicit calls
3. Arrow functions
4. Bound functions

Below is the procedure to find the binding of `this` in function `f`:

## Exercises!
Given `magic` defined as follows:
```js
'use strict';

const magic = function() {
	// a. what is `this`?
    console.log(this);
    
	const cool = () => {
		// b. what is `this`?
	    console.log(this);
	};
	cool();
};

// QUESTION 1
magic();


// QUESTION 2
const apple = { name: 'apple' };
apple.magic = magic;
apple.magic();

// QUESTION 3
const orange = { name: 'orange' };
magic.call(orange);
```

### QUESTION 1.a
Following flow chart, we want to find `this` in `magic`.

1. Category of `magic` is normal function
2. `magic` is called implicitly (directly)
3. `magic` is called with `magic()`
4. So `this` = `undefined`!!!

### QUESTION 1.b
Following flow chart, we want to find `this` in `cool`.

1. Category of `cool` is arrow function
2. From QUESTION 1.b, we know `magic`'s `this` is `undefined`
3.  `cool`'s caller's is `magic`
4. So `this` = `magic`'s `this` = `undefined`!


## Lazy lecturer

The remaining questions, QUESTION 2.a, 2.b, 3.a and 3.b, are trivial with my flow chart. So I will leave them as an exercise for you all.

Click run and you will see the answer in order (1.a, 1.b, 2.a, 2.b, 3.a, 3.b).

## Note
- There is no "bound arrow function". `(() => {...}).bind(...)` is still the original arrow function.
- For implicit calling, only the shape (`f()` or `obj.f()`) matter. It doesn't matter where `f` comes from. Consider the following code:
```js
const f = obj.f; // obj.f is a normal function
f(); // `this` in the body of `f` is `undefined`!!! not `obj`!!!
```
